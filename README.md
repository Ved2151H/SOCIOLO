SOCIOLO is an Android-first, map-based social event app that helps people connect in the real world.

Users can create or join small, time-bound events like coffee meetups, sports, study sessions, or casual hangouts, all shown on a nearby map. The app focuses on spontaneous plans and accurate location sharing, including support for DigiPIN for precise meetup points in India.

SOCIOLO is built with a safety-first approach, featuring a dedicated Panic Mode for emergencies during meetups and backend-controlled rules to keep events limited, secure, and temporary.
